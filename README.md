# PU-Foam-Project
Synthesized polyurethane (PU) foams incorporating eco-friendly polyols and optimized formulations for enhanced mechanical and thermal properties.
Characterized foam morphology using SEM and analyzed compressive strength and density for structural integrity assessment.
Explored bio-based alternatives to conventional PU components to improve sustainability and reduce environmental footprint.
